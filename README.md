Reattempting the Odin project to move forth in a new career.  I have a lot to learn to build on my base knowledge.  I plan on mocking my first website right now




upon finsihing it took about 2 hours most css work besides alignment was made by myself.  bottom still needs a little work but in the end i am happy with what i have done

Another hour on a second night and i have everything alligned correctly using at least semi correct css.  All items that should be clickable are.
